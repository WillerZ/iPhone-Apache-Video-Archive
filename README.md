If you have a load of .m4v files on a server in sensibly-named directories this will give you a nice iPhone interface to them, presuming that your server runs Apache and you're using the default directory listings.

It works by reading the html Apache generates for directory listings and creating a nice menu system based on that.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Copy everything from here except README into the top-level directory of your video archive site.

Copy the 'jqtouch' and 'themes' directories from [JQTouch](http://jqtouch.com) into that directory.
