If you have a load of .m4v files on a server in sensibly-named directories
this will give you a nice iPhone interface to them, presuming that your server
runs Apache and you're using the default directory listings.

It works by reading the html Apache generates for directory listings and
creating a nice menu system based on that.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Copy everything except README into the top-level directory of your video
archive site. Visit iphone.html on that site.
